\arguments{
\item{substrateNames}{a vector of substrate names}

\item{substrateMeans}{a named vector of substrate means, e.g. c(A=1,B=2,C=3)}

\item{num.days}{number of days simulation is over}

\item{breakfast.start}{time to start breakfast (24h clock), default is 7am}

\item{lunch.start}{time to start lunch (24h clock), default is 1pm}

\item{dinner.start}{time to start dinner (24h clock), default is 7pm}

\item{time.step.h}{the model time step converted from days to hours}

\item{meal.duration.h}{length of time for a meal (in hours)}

\item{fluc.comp}{LOGICAL. TRUE for fluctating meal composition}

\item{time.to.reach.colon.h}{time from ingestion to reaching colon (hours)}

\item{gamma.mag}{a number controlling the shape of the gamma function}

\item{RS.frac}{Fraction of carbs that is RS}

\item{showPlot}{produce plot of inflow}

\item{saveFig}{save plot of inflow}

\item{waterName}{string for the name of the water variable. Default is 'H2O'}

\item{waterMean}{number for mean inflow of water to colon (g/d). Default is 1100 g/d}
}
\value{
a matrix for substrate inflow (g/d) for each substrate and water (cols) at each model time step (rows). The first col is time in days.
