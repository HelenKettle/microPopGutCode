  num.days = 3,
  breakfast.start = 7,
  lunch.start = 13,

}
\arguments{
\item{num.days}{number of days simulation is over}

\item{breakfast.start}{time to start breakfast (24h clock), default is 7am}

\item{lunch.start}{time to start lunch (24h clock), default is 1pm}

\item{dinner.start}{time to start dinner (24h clock), default is 7pm}

\item{time.step.h}{the model time step converted from days to hours}

\item{meal.duration.h}{length of time for a meal (in hours)}

\item{showPlot}{Logical produce plot of inflow (defaults to FALSE)}
}
\value{
is a 2 column matrix with time in hours (col 1) and meals (mean=1)
}
\description{
this function generates a step function which is 1 for eating time and 0 if not eating. This is then converted to have a mean of 1 over the  model simulation time
Note this function is in hours (unlike rest of package)
}
