\usage{
computeSCFA(out, SCFAnames, molarMass, waterName = "H2O")
}
\arguments{
\item{out}{is the output of microPopGut()$solution[[n]]. It is a matrix of all model state variables (columns) at each output time (rows) for compartment n}

\item{SCFAnames}{vector of strings which are the names of the SCFA}

\item{molarMass}{is the molar mass of each resource}

\item{waterName}{is the name of the water variable}
}
\value{
returns a matrix with SCFA in each column and rows over time
}
\description{
calculates SCFA (mM) from model results
}
