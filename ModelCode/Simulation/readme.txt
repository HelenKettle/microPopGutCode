The model simulations were run in batch mode with parameters specified on the command line (on a linux multi-core machine). However, the scripts in 

microPopGut/Rpackage/DemoFiles/

show how to run the model. These are explained in the pdf:

microPopGut/Rpackage/getStartedWithMicroPopGut.pdf

(the package vignette).
